This oversight ensures that financial resources are being utilized effectively and in accordance with established policies and regulations.<br><br><h4>Risk Management:</h4> Identifying and managing financial risks is a critical task. The committee assesses potential risks such as market volatility, regulatory changes, and economic downturns. It then formulates strategies to mitigate these risks and protect the organization's financial stability.<br><br><h4>Budgeting and Planning:</h4> The finance committee collaborates with management to develop and approve budgets that align with the organization's strategic goals. It evaluates the feasibility of financial projections, cost estimates, and revenue forecasts, making adjustments as necessary.</p>
